Examples

In the *examples* folder of the repository are three examples showing how to used the code.
Each considers a different test case: a Gaussian likelihood with a parameter independent mean,  a Gaussian likelihood with a parameter dependent mean, and a Poisson case.

These examples show how to use the main functionality of the code. Further details on each method can be found in :ref:`api <api>`
